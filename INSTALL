INSTALLING GYOTO
================

I- INSTALL THE DEPENDENCIES
===========================
   - xercesc-3 (recommended, required for the executable):
       http://xerces.apache.org/xerces-c/
   - cfitsio   (required for the executable)
       http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/fitsio/
   - LORENE (optional, the libgyoto-lorene plug-in can be built later)
       http://www.lorene.obspm.fr/
     On some systems, LORENE must be built with -fPIC (GYOTO as well,
     but this is the default).

II- CONFIGURE GYOTO
===================
Edit local_settings to suite your needs

III- BUILD
==========
   $ make

IV- TEST
========

Several example files are provided in doc/examples. All the files
withous "rotstar3_1" should work out of the box. The rotstar3_1
require the lorene plugin and some work to create lorene data
files. You can ray-trace all these sceneries (may take up to a couple
of minutes on recent hardware) with:

   $ make check

Don't worry too much for the "severe" warnings.

You can now open the resulting FITS files with ds9
(http://hea-www.harvard.edu/RD/ds9/) or spydr
(http://www.maumae.net/yorick/doc/spydr_intro.php) or any other
FITS-aware image viewer:

   $ spydr example-*.fits

V- INSTALL
=============
If installing to a system location (i.e. if you don't
have right access to PREFIX), you need to gain root privileges using,
for instance, su or sudo:
1- using su:
   $ su -
    (type root password)
   # make install

2- using sudo:
   $ sudo make install
    (type your password)

Under Linux, if installing to a system location, you may need to also
run
   # ldconfig -v
or
   $ sudo ldconfig -v

If installing in a non-standard place (e.g. under your home
directory), you should not run ldconfig but make sure that $PREFIX/lib
is listed in the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable (Under Mac OS X,
it is called DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH). It goes beyond the scope of this
manual to teach you how to set environment variables; if in doubt ask
the local guru or google...

VI- BUILD AND INSTALL THE YORICK PLUGIN
=======================================
If you also want the Yorick plug-in:
1- install yorick (http://yorick.sourceforge.net/);
2- Run:
   $ make yorick
   $ make check-yorick
   $ sudo make install-yorick

VII- BUILD THE DOCUMENTATION
============================

To build the documentaion, "make doc".
