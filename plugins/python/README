This is a python plug-in for Gyoto. It is part of Gyoto and has the
same copyright (GPL v3+). It is packaged in a subdirectory as an
example for packaging Gyoto plug-ins.

It is currently in development. The purpose is to be able to define
some objects (e.g. spectra online in python instead of having to write
a new C++ class each time.

Coding your new Metric, Astrobj or Spectrum class in Python is
efficient in terms of human resources, while coding it in C++ is much
more efficient in terms of computing resources.

The content of plugins/python/doc/examples should give enough
resources to get started. The gyoto_sample_*.py modules contain
documentation about how to code a class in Python while the test*.py
scripts give an idea of how to instanciate and use such classes using
the Python bindings. One can also directly load the provided XML files
into the stand-alonoe gyoto executable by using the --plugins
option. Note that multi-threading is not efficient when using a Python
metric in particular, but MPI parallelization works quite well, so you
command line could look something like:

  mpirun -np 4 gyoto --plugins=python3,stdplug -P-1 input.xml \!output.fits

For more information or for information on writing your new class in
C++, please refer to Sect. 9 of the Gyoto manual, available as
doc/user_guide/GyotoManual.pdf once Gyoto has been built on your
system, or at https://gyoto.obspm.fr/GyotoManual.pdf
