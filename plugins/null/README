This is an example of a Gyoto plug-in.

To make your own,

1- choose a cool name;
2- copy this directory (plugins/null/) somewhere;
3- edit configure.ac and lib/Makefile.ac: replace any occurrence of
   "null" with your cool name;
4- add new metrics and astrobjs as needed in lib/ and include/, the
   gyoto source code is also full of examples;
5- edit lib/NullPlug.C to register your new classes (rename it to
   CoolPlug.C if you wish);
6- run autoreconf (whenever you edit any configure.ac or Makefile.am
   file), then ./configure, make, make install...
7- if installing to default directories (/usr/local/lib), you may need
   to run 'sudo ldconfig'
8- You can now start using your plug-in by loading it with any of the
   available methods:
     - In XML: <Astrobj plugin="null" kind="null"/>
     - On the command line: gyoto -pstdplug,null ...
     - In Python:
          gyoto.loadPlugin('null')
     - In all cases: export GYOTO_PLUGINS="stdplug,null"
